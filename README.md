# Credit_Risk_Analysis

##Overview of the Analysis

The purpose of this project is to build and evaluate several machine learning models to predict credit risk through the use of Python. After evaluating each model, a recommendation on which one is the best fit to predict credit risk.

Resources used:
* Data Source: LoanStats_2019Q1
* Software used: Jupyter Notebook, Python 3.7, Anaconda Navigator 2.1.1

## Results of all Machine Learning Models

### RandomOverSampler model
* The accuracy score for the model is 65%.
* The high risk precision is about 1% and only 62% sensitivity which makes a F1 score of 2%.
* The high number of low risk population, its precision almost 100% with a sensitivty score 68%.
